# Jellyfish

These are not official documentations, nothing here is set in stone.  These are just base ideas I might want in a programming language.  I haven't decided to build or develop this language yet, nor have I finalized anything.  In short, this is a brainstorm.

Jellyfish is an amalgamation of things I like from Typescript, Java, JavaScript and Python.  It is meant to be a procedural language with support for classical inheritance OOP and functional programming.  It would also be a general purpose language, with memory management and pointers abstracted away from the user.

The rest of the details are, as I said, a brainstorm and not set in stone, not even whether it's JIT or compiled.
